# OBuildFactory

![OBuildFactory Logo](https://raw.github.com/hgomez/obuildfactory/master/OBuildFactory-Logo.png)

This GitHub project  provides build scripts for OpenJDK 7, 8, 8+Lambda, 8+Jigsaw.

These scripts add goodies like :

* ROOT CA generation, update and inclusion
* FreeType build and embedding on platform where minimal requirements are not met.
* Native packages support, aka Linux RPMs up to trusted Yum repository population.
* OSX DMG for easy install via drag&drop.


You could use these scripts from a Jenkins Powered environment to setup a Continuous Integration chain or standalone for one shot builds.

Initialy planned for Linux, this project also include Mac OSX scripts from [openjdk-osx-build](http://code.google.com/p/openjdk-osx-build/)

## OSX

I don't have anymore OSX machines so I won't be able to help on Apple platforms.
There is some wiki pages who detailed how to build, but there is no guaranty about success.
BTW, I'll welcome pull-requests so it will help others OSX users.
